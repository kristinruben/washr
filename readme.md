Washr

Washr is a Ruby on Rails web app that uses crowdsourced data to allow users to check the number of washers and dryers available at their local laundromat. I incorporated the Google Places API for searching laundromats, as well as AJAX functionality with JavaScript charts that pull from a PostgreSQL database for data visualization.

I built this app because I believe that it satisfies a current need. Nobody likes schlepping their laundry to the laundromat only to find that it is too busy and there are no washers or dryers available.
